## 1. The Basics (Logic Building and What is Programming)

[Introduction to Programming and Computer Science - Full Course (freeCodeCamp)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOjov-2OZ0E&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)

[CS50 Lectures 2020](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhQjrBD2T382_R182iC2gNZI9HzWFMC_8)

These are introductory courses to programming you will learn the basics of programming with theses courses.

## 2. Getting started with a programming language

I would suggest learn Java at this point it would take time to learn but its very beneficial
for you in the longer run, alternatively you can learn python its python have lots of learning resources and very easy for beginners.
